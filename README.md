## Endpoints
You can go to http://localhost:8000/api#/ai/ChatController_run

Each turn, you want to take the `CHAT_SESSION_ID` from the response header and use that in the request header for next turn.

Leave `CHAT_SESSION_ID` blank when you make the first call. A new session and ID will be created and returned.
